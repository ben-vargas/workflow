You can add your workflow step to the [registry](https://workflow.vercel.app/steps) by submitting a pull request that updates the `registry.json` file.

## Prerequisites

Before submitting your step, ensure you have:

- Published your step package to npm (or it's a standalone step)
- Documented your step with clear usage instructions
- Tested your step with Vercel Workflow
- Followed workflow best practices for durability and observability

## Adding Your Step

### 1. Fork and clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/workflow
cd workflow
```

Follow the setup instructions in the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) if available.

### 2. Add your step entry

Navigate to the docs directory and open `registry.json`:

```bash
cd docs
```

Add a new step object to the `items` array following this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "your-step-slug",
  "name": "Your Step Name",
  "description": "Clear description of what your step does and its capabilities",
  "category": "ai", // Options: ai, data, database, integration, utility
  "type": "external", // or "native"
  "author": "Your Name or Organization",
  "featured": false,
  "packageName": "your-package-name", // Optional: if published to npm
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "apiKeyEnvName": "YOUR_API_KEY", // Optional: environment variable name
  "installCommand": {
    "pnpm": "pnpm install your-package-name",
    "npm": "npm install your-package-name",
    "yarn": "yarn add your-package-name",
    "bun": "bun add your-package-name"
  },
  "codeExample": "import { yourStep } from 'your-package-name';\n\nexport async function myWorkflow() {\n  \"use workflow\";\n  \n  const result = await yourStep({\n    // step configuration\n  });\n  \n  return result;\n}",
  "docsUrl": "https://your-docs-url.com",
  "apiKeyUrl": "https://your-api-key-url.com", // Optional
  "websiteUrl": "https://your-website.com",
  "npmUrl": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/your-package-name"
}
```

### 3. Provide a working code example

Your `codeExample` should:

- Be a complete, working example
- Show realistic usage of your step within a workflow
- Include the `"use workflow"` directive
- Use proper async/await patterns
- Include necessary imports
- Be tested to ensure it works

Example:

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from '@acme/workflow-email';

export async function notificationWorkflow(userId: string) {
  "use workflow";
  
  // Fetch user data (durable step)
  const user = await fetchUser(userId);
  
  // Send email (your custom step)
  const result = await sendEmail({
    to: user.email,
    subject: 'Welcome!',
    body: `Hello ${user.name}!`
  });
  
  return result;
}
```

### 4. Update the categories

If you're adding a new category, update the `categories` array:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "your-category",
      "name": "Your Category",
      "description": "Description of this category"
    }
  ]
}
```

Available categories:
- **ai**: AI and machine learning operations
- **data**: Data processing and transformation
- **database**: Database queries and operations
- **integration**: External service integrations
- **utility**: Helper functions and utilities

### 5. Submit your pull request

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feat/add-step-your-step-name

# Add and commit your changes
git add docs/registry.json
git commit -m "feat(registry): add your-step-name"

# Push and create a pull request
git push origin feat/add-step-your-step-name
```

Use the PR title format: `feat(registry): add your-step-name`

## Step Requirements

### Code Quality

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Include proper type definitions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add JSDoc comments

### Workflow Best Practices

- Make steps idempotent where possible
- Use appropriate timeouts
- Include retry logic for transient failures
- Avoid side effects in step definitions

### Documentation

Include in your step's README:

- Clear description of what the step does
- Installation instructions
- Configuration options
- Usage examples
- Required environment variables
- Dependencies

### Testing

Ensure your step:

- Has unit tests
- Has integration tests with Workflow
- Works in both development and production
- Handles edge cases appropriately

## Review Process

Once you submit your PR:

1. Automated checks will verify your submission
2. A maintainer will review your code and documentation
3. You may be asked to make changes
4. Once approved, your step will be added to the registry

## Questions?

If you have questions about adding your step to the registry:

- Check the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
- Review existing step entries in `registry.json` for examples
- Browse the [step documentation](/steps)
- Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/issues)

## Next Steps

After your step is accepted:

- Share it with the community
- Keep it updated with new Workflow features
- Respond to user feedback and issues
- Consider contributing more steps!
