Learn how to install and use pre-built workflow steps from the registry.

## Installing Steps

You can install steps from the registry using the Workflow CLI:

```bash

```

This will:
1. Download the step code to your project
2. Install any required dependencies
3. Configure the step for use in your workflows

## Using Registry Steps

Once installed, you can import and use registry steps in your workflows:

```typescript
import { registryStep } from "@/workflows/steps/registry-step";

export async function myWorkflow() {
  "use workflow";
  
  const result = await registryStep({
    // step configuration
  });
  
  return result;
}
```
