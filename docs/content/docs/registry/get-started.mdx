The Workflow Registry provides a collection of pre-built, reusable workflow steps that you can easily integrate into your applications.

## What is the Registry?

The registry is a curated collection of workflow steps that solve common use cases, such as:

- Data processing and transformation
- API integrations
- File operations
- Database queries
- External service integrations

## Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Use battle-tested components instead of building from scratch
- **Best Practices**: Steps follow workflow best practices for durability and observability
- **Community-Driven**: Contribute your own steps and benefit from community contributions

## Quick Start

To get started with the registry:

1. Browse available steps in the registry
2. Install the steps you need using the CLI
3. Import and use them in your workflows

See the [Installation](/docs/registry/installation) guide for detailed instructions.
