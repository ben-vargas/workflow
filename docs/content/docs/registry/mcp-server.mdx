title: MCP Server
description: Use the Model Context Protocol server to integrate workflow steps with AI tools.
---

The Workflow Registry includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants and tools to discover and use workflow steps.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI tools to interact with external systems and data sources. The Workflow Registry MCP server exposes registry steps as tools that AI assistants can use.

## Starting the MCP Server

Start the registry MCP server:

```bash
npx workflow mcp
```

The server will start and expose all available registry steps as MCP tools.

## Configuration

Configure the MCP server in your workflow configuration:

```typescript title="workflow.config.ts"
export default {
  mcp: {
    port: 3001,
    enabled: true,
    steps: [
      // Specify which steps to expose via MCP
      "data-transform",
      "api-call",
      // Or use "*" to expose all steps
    ]
  }
}
```

## Using with AI Assistants

Once the MCP server is running, AI assistants can:

1. Discover available workflow steps
2. Understand their parameters and capabilities
3. Execute steps as part of larger workflows
4. Chain multiple steps together

## Security

The MCP server includes built-in security features:

- Authentication via API keys
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Sandboxed execution

Configure security settings in your `workflow.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default {
  mcp: {
    auth: {
      apiKey: process.env.MCP_API_KEY,
      allowedOrigins: ["https://your-app.com"]
    },
    rateLimit: {
      maxRequests: 100,
      windowMs: 60000
    }
  }
}
```
